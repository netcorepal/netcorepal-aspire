# OpenGauss Example

This is a simple example demonstrating how to use the `NetCorePal.Aspire.Hosting.OpenGauss` package in a .NET Aspire application.

## What This Example Shows

- Adding an OpenGauss server resource to your Aspire application
- Creating a database within the OpenGauss server
- Using data volumes for persistence
- Basic resource configuration

## Running the Example

```bash
dotnet run
```

To actually start the OpenGauss container and run the full Aspire application, uncomment the last line in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Build().Run();
```

Then run:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The application will start and you can access the Aspire dashboard to monitor the OpenGauss container.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine running
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- .NET Aspire 13.0.2 or later

## What Gets Created

When you run this example with the full application:

1. An OpenGauss container using the `opengauss/opengauss:6.0.0` image
2. A named volume for data persistence
3. A database named "mydb" within the OpenGauss server
4. Automatic health checks to ensure the database is ready before dependent services start

## Connection String

The connection string for the database will be automatically generated and available to dependent resources:

```
Host=<host>;Port=<port>;Username=gaussdb;Password=<auto-generated>;Database=mydb
```
